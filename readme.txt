PROMPTS

On github, I have a repository located here: https://github.com/orion-productions/website-basic
Note that this is orion-productions profile on GitHub, and not jmerceron profile.
In that repository, I would like to create a very simple website that is meant to the hosted by Github and be found under the public link of "https://orion-productions.github.io/"
There will be 1 page. Black background. Top right corner, a language selection menu supporting English (default language on the page), French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and the arabic languages. middle of the page, the Orion Productrions logo (a PNG format file I will drop where you see fit), and bellow the logo 2 lines of text: in white "Welcome to Orion Productions", and bellow in yellow and smaller letters: "Advancing the Creative Industries on Technology, Production and Education".  I would like to vibe code it using Codespaces and Github copilot. What is your suggested plan?


please execute the plan, and then provide a local link that allow me to open the website in my browser to check the result.


I added the logo file. Can you update?


excellent! The result is excellent. Good work! Excellent work! Can you now commit and push to https://github.com/orion-productions/website-basic ?


did you see any error as you were committing and pushing? I do not see yet the files on  


Repository exists already, the problem is access... do you want me to get a key from github on that repository to allow your operations?



I have the token... what should I do now?



Next Step: Enable GitHub Pages
Go to: https://github.com/orion-productions/website-basic
Click "Settings" tab
Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
Click "Save"
Your website will be live at:
https://orion-productions.github.io/website-basic/
The authentication worked perfectly with your token! Your website is now ready to be deployed on GitHub Pages. Once you enable Pages in the repository settings, it will be accessible to the world with all the multilingual features and beautiful design we created.



does it take time before I can use "@https://orion-productions.github.io/website-basic/"? I get a 404 message on the website, even after activating Pages for website-basic.


(wait - cache - use other browser)


you were correct, once again ! Well done !
Now, how to get this website to be the profile website as well for the orion-productions github?



the repository exist, and maybe it needs to be cleaned first because there are files in there that could be introducing bugs and issues?


I would like you to get rid of all what is in there so we have a clean content in the repository



did you also commit and push the readme.txt to webpages-basic?


üìÅ Both repositories now contain:
index.html - Main website
styles.css - Styling
script.js - Multilingual functionality
assets/orion-logo.png - Your logo
README.md - Main documentation
readme.txt - Project notes and documentation
assets/logo-placeholder.html - Instructions
üåê Your websites are live at:
Main site: https://orion-productions.github.io/website-basic/
Profile site: https://orion-productions.github.io/
The readme.txt file now contains clean project documentation without any sensitive information, and it's been successfully pushed to both repositories. GitHub's security protection worked correctly by preventing the token from being exposed publicly!
